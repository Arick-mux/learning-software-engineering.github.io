## Table of Contents
## Introduction
Auto-configuration in Spring Boot is a pivotal feature, designed to simplify application development by automatically configuring Spring Beans based on the application's dependencies and configuration. This feature is realized through conditional configurations, meaning configurations are applied only under specific conditions, such as the presence of certain dependencies, configuration values, or environment variables.
